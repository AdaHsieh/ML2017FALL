## Dependency
* Python 3.6
* Keras==2.0.9
* tensorflow-gpu==1.4.0
* numpy 1.13.3
* nltk==3.2.5

## Usage
#### **Download preprocessed data**
>Since we made some modification to the dataset, we attached `preprocessed.py` script and download preprocessed data directly
```commandline
cd ./final/src/Preprocessed_data
sh preprocessed_data_download.sh
cd ..
```
#### **Download word2vec model & network model**
```commandline
cd ./final/src/Models/save
sh model.sh
cd ../..
```
#### Predict R-NET
>Make sure the terminal is in the `\src`
Simply executing the following. The result `prediction.csv` will be in the same folder.

```commandline
python prediction.py
```
## OOM
* The full model could not be trained with NVIDIA Tesla K40m with 12GiB memory. Tensorflow will report serious OOM problem. There are a few possible solutions.

Run with CPU. This can be achieved by assigning a device mask with command line as follows. In fact, my implementation result shown in the previous section was generated by a model trained with CPU. However, this might cause extremely slow training speed. In my experience, it might cost roughly 24 hours per epoch.

```commandline
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" python prediction.py
```
